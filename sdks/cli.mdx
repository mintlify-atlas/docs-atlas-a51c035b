description: Command-line interface for interacting with the Trieve API for file uploads, search, and RAG queries
---

The Trieve CLI provides a convenient command-line interface for interacting with the Trieve API. Upload files, check processing status, ask questions against your knowledge base, and configure your RAG system directly from your terminal.

## Installation

Install the CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g trieve-cli
```

## Configuration

Before using the CLI, configure it with your Trieve credentials:

```bash
trieve configure
```

This interactive command will prompt you for:

- **Trieve Organization ID**: Your organization UUID from the dashboard
- **Trieve Dataset ID**: The dataset UUID you want to work with
- **Trieve API Key**: Your API key from dashboard settings
- **User ID**: For topic ownership (used in RAG queries)

### Environment Variables

Alternatively, set these environment variables instead of using the configure command:

```bash
export TRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_ID="your-org-id"
export TRIEVE_DATASET_ID="your-dataset-id"
export TRIEVE_API_KEY="tr-********************************"
```

## Commands

### Upload Files

Upload a file to your Trieve dataset:

```bash
trieve upload [filePath]
```

**Options:**

- `-t, --tracking-id <trackingId>`: Optional custom tracking ID for the file

**Examples:**

```bash
# Upload a specific file
trieve upload ./documents/report.pdf

# Upload with a custom tracking ID
trieve upload ./docs/guide.md --tracking-id "guide-v2"

# Interactive mode (prompts for file path)
trieve upload
```

### Check Upload Status

Check the processing status of your uploaded files:

```bash
trieve check-upload-status [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-t, --tracking-id <trackingId>`: Check status for a specific tracking ID

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive mode - shows menu of uploaded files
trieve check-upload-status

# Check specific file by tracking ID
trieve check-upload-status --tracking-id "guide-v2"
```

The status command shows:

- File processing state (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Number of chunks created
- Any errors encountered during processing

### Ask Questions

Ask questions against your Trieve dataset using RAG:

```bash
trieve ask [question]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Ask a specific question
trieve ask "What are the key findings in the report?"

# Interactive mode (prompts for question)
trieve ask
```

The response is streamed back in real-time and includes:

- AI-generated answer based on your dataset
- Source references with expandable details (press 'j' to expand)
- Relevant chunks used to generate the answer

### Update Tool Configuration

Customize the RAG system prompt and tool behavior:

```bash
trieve update-tool-config [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-t, --tool-description <toolDescription>`: Instructions for when the LLM should use the search tool
- `-q, --query-description <queryDescription>`: How the LLM should formulate search queries
- `-s, --system-prompt <systemPrompt>`: Custom system prompt for the AI assistant

**Examples:**

```bash
# Update query description
trieve update-tool-config --query-description "Create precise search queries focusing on technical terms"

# Update system prompt
trieve update-tool-config --system-prompt "You are a helpful technical documentation assistant"

# Update multiple settings
trieve update-tool-config \
  --tool-description "Use this tool for technical documentation queries" \
  --query-description "Focus on API endpoints and code examples" \
  --system-prompt "You are an expert API documentation assistant"
```

## Features

### Secure Configuration

Your API keys and configuration are stored locally and securely. The CLI never logs or transmits your credentials except when making authorized API requests.

### File Upload Support

The CLI supports uploading various file formats:

- PDF documents
- Markdown files
- Text files
- HTML files
- Word documents
- And more

### Status Tracking

Track the processing status of your uploaded files:

- Monitor when files are being processed
- See how many chunks were created
- Identify and troubleshoot any errors

### Interactive Q&A

Ask questions and receive AI-generated answers based on your uploaded documents:

- Streamed responses for real-time feedback
- Source references for transparency
- Expandable details to see the underlying data

### Customizable RAG

Fine-tune the RAG behavior:

- Configure when the search tool is invoked
- Customize how search queries are formulated
- Set custom system prompts for domain-specific responses

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete workflow using the Trieve CLI:

```bash
# 1. Configure the CLI (first time only)
trieve configure

# 2. Upload a document
trieve upload ./documents/technical-guide.pdf --tracking-id "tech-guide-v1"

# 3. Check if processing is complete
trieve check-upload-status --tracking-id "tech-guide-v1"

# 4. Customize the RAG configuration
trieve update-tool-config \
  --query-description "Create precise technical queries" \
  --system-prompt "You are a technical documentation expert"

# 5. Ask a question about the content
trieve ask "What are the installation requirements?"

# 6. Ask follow-up questions
trieve ask "How do I configure the system?"
```

## Development

Build the CLI from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve.git
cd trieve/clients/cli

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Run locally
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Found

If you see "Configuration not found" errors:

```bash
# Reconfigure the CLI
trieve configure

# Or set environment variables
export TRIEVE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export TRIEVE_DATASET_ID="your-dataset-id"
export TRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_ID="your-org-id"
```

### Upload Failures

If file uploads fail:

- Check that the file exists and is readable
- Verify your API key has upload permissions
- Check file size limits in your plan
- Ensure the file format is supported

### RAG Queries Not Working

If RAG queries return errors:

- Ensure files have finished processing
- Verify your dataset has content
- Check that your API key has search permissions
- Try simplifying your question
